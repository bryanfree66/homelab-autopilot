> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alpha Software**: Currently in active development (Phase 1). Not yet ready for production use.

## üéØ What is Homelab Autopilot?

Homelab Autopilot is an open-source automation framework that **unifies backup management across VMs, LXC containers, Docker, and bare-metal** with intelligent application-aware orchestration. We solve the critical gap that no existing tool addresses: comprehensive homelab automation that treats Docker as a first-class citizen.

### Why Homelab Autopilot?

**Existing tools fall short for homelabs:**
- **Proxmox Backup Server**: Excellent VM/LXC backups, but no Docker intelligence or host config GUI
- **Veeam**: Doesn't support LXC containers, forcing you to run dual backup systems
- **Community Scripts**: Focus on deployment, not ongoing backup and update management
- **Manual Solutions**: Fragile, error-prone, and time-consuming

**Homelab Autopilot fills the gaps:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker-Native Backups**: Application-aware backups that understand your containers (databases, volumes, configs)
- ‚úÖ **Unified Multi-Workload**: Single tool for VMs + LXC + Docker + host configs
- ‚úÖ **PBS Integration**: Leverage Proxmox Backup Server's proven deduplication (10-50x) when you want it
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Storage**: Compression-only, PBS, or future native deduplication‚Äîyour choice
- ‚úÖ **Automated Restore Testing**: Monthly verification that your backups actually work (most find out they don't during disasters)
- ‚úÖ **Safety-First Design**: Snapshots before changes, automatic rollback, production patterns for homelabs

### Core Philosophy

- **Safety First**: Always backup before making changes, verify restores actually work
- **Fail Gracefully**: Automatic rollback on failures with RTO tracking
- **Integration Over Replacement**: Extend PBS and Proxmox, don't compete with them
- **Docker Intelligence**: Application-aware backups with database dumps, maintenance mode
- **Keep It Simple**: Single binary deployment, 5-minute setup, Python-first
- **Stay Informed**: Smart notifications only when needed

- ‚úÖ **Automated restore testing**‚Äîmonthly verification with RTO tracking
- ‚úÖ **Safety-first design**‚Äîsnapshots, rollback, error handling built-in
- ‚úÖ **Centralized logging and state**‚Äîknow what happened and when
- ‚úÖ **Production patterns**‚Äîretry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation

### vs. Community Helper Scripts
- ‚úÖ **Ongoing management**‚Äînot just deployment
- ‚úÖ **Backup + monitoring + updates**‚Äîcomplete lifecycle automation
- ‚úÖ **Plugin architecture**‚Äîextend without forking
- ‚úÖ **Production-grade testing**‚Äî98% coverage, 10.0/10 pylint score
