> ⚠️ **Alpha Software**: Currently in active development (Phase 1). Not yet ready for production use.

## 🎯 What is Homelab Autopilot?

Homelab Autopilot is an open-source automation framework that **unifies backup management across VMs, LXC containers, Docker, and bare-metal** with intelligent application-aware orchestration. We solve the critical gap that no existing tool addresses: comprehensive homelab automation that treats Docker as a first-class citizen.

### Why Homelab Autopilot?

**Existing tools fall short for homelabs:**
- **Proxmox Backup Server**: Excellent VM/LXC backups, but no Docker intelligence or host config GUI
- **Veeam**: Doesn't support LXC containers, forcing you to run dual backup systems
- **Community Scripts**: Focus on deployment, not ongoing backup and update management
- **Manual Solutions**: Fragile, error-prone, and time-consuming

**Homelab Autopilot fills the gaps:**
- ✅ **Docker-Native Backups**: Application-aware backups that understand your containers (databases, volumes, configs)
- ✅ **Unified Multi-Workload**: Single tool for VMs + LXC + Docker + host configs
- ✅ **PBS Integration**: Leverage Proxmox Backup Server's proven deduplication (10-50x) when you want it
- ✅ **Flexible Storage**: Compression-only, PBS, or future native deduplication—your choice
- ✅ **Automated Restore Testing**: Monthly verification that your backups actually work (most find out they don't during disasters)
- ✅ **Safety-First Design**: Snapshots before changes, automatic rollback, production patterns for homelabs

### Core Philosophy

- **Safety First**: Always backup before making changes, verify restores actually work
- **Fail Gracefully**: Automatic rollback on failures with RTO tracking
- **Integration Over Replacement**: Extend PBS and Proxmox, don't compete with them
- **Docker Intelligence**: Application-aware backups with database dumps, maintenance mode
- **Keep It Simple**: Single binary deployment, 5-minute setup, Python-first
- **Stay Informed**: Smart notifications only when needed

## 🌟 What Makes Us Different

### vs. Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)
- ✅ **We integrate with PBS**, not replace it—leverage PBS's 10-50x deduplication when you want it
- ✅ **Docker-native backups**—PBS doesn't understand containers
- ✅ **Host config GUI**—PBS requires command-line for host backups
- ✅ **Automated restore testing**—verify backups actually work
- ✅ **Flexible storage**—compression-only option for small homelabs without PBS complexity

### vs. Veeam
- ✅ **LXC container support**—Veeam doesn't, forcing dual backup systems
- ✅ **Free for all homelab sizes**—no per-VM licensing
- ✅ **Unified Docker + VM backups**—single tool, single workflow
- ✅ **Linux-native**—no Windows server required

### vs. Manual Scripts
- ✅ **Application-aware**—understands databases, volumes, dependencies
- ✅ **Automated restore testing**—monthly verification with RTO tracking
- ✅ **Safety-first design**—snapshots, rollback, error handling built-in
- ✅ **Centralized logging and state**—know what happened and when
- ✅ **Production patterns**—retry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation

### vs. Community Helper Scripts
- ✅ **Ongoing management**—not just deployment
- ✅ **Backup + monitoring + updates**—complete lifecycle automation
- ✅ **Plugin architecture**—extend without forking
- ✅ **Production-grade testing**—98% coverage, 10.0/10 pylint score

### Cluster Support (Phases 3-6)
- ✅ **Cluster-ready architecture from day one**—no breaking changes needed later
- ✅ **Smart design**—query VM locations dynamically, support shared storage
- ✅ **Rolling updates**—update cluster nodes safely one at a time (Phase 3)
- ✅ **HA awareness**—respect high-availability during operations
- ✅ **Full cluster features**—multi-node failover, auto-discovery (Phase 6)
- 📝 **Even in Phase 2**: Service configs include `node` field, PBS works cluster-wide
