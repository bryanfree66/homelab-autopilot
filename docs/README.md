## 🎯 What is Homelab Autopilot?

Homelab Autopilot is an open-source automation framework that helps homelab enthusiasts safely maintain their infrastructure with automated backups, monitoring, and updates. Think of it as a safety net that catches problems before they become disasters.

### Core Philosophy

- **Safety First**: Always backup before making changes
- **Fail Gracefully**: Automatic rollback on failures
- **Keep It Simple**: Python-first, minimal dependencies
- **Stay Informed**: Smart notifications only when needed

## ✨ Features

### Current (Phase 1 - In Development)

- ✅ **Configuration Management**
  - YAML-based configuration with Pydantic validation
  - Type-safe configuration models
  - Dot notation access and config merging
  - Comprehensive validation and error reporting

### Planned Features

- 🔄 **Automated Backups** (Phase 2)
  - VM/LXC backups via hypervisor APIs
  - Service configuration backups
  - Configurable retention policies
  - Compression and deduplication

- 🔄 **Safe Updates** (Phase 3)
  - Pre-update backups
  - Automated updates with rollback
  - Service validation after updates
  - Update scheduling and batching

- 🔄 **Health Monitoring** (Phase 4)
  - Service health checks
  - Resource monitoring
  - Automated recovery actions
  - Historical metrics

- 📬 **Smart Notifications** (Phase 2+)
  - Email, Slack, Discord, webhooks
  - Configurable alert levels
  - Notification cooldowns
  - Digest summaries

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
